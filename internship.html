            <h1>Institute’s 6-Months Internship Policy</h1></a>
            <h2>Preamble</br>
                <h3> Internship undoubtedly enhances the practical exposure and skills of a student and eventually
                    his/her
                    employability. At present. all engineering undergraduates are undergoing following:
                    <br />
                    1. Workshop Training after 2nd Semester,</br>
                    2. 4 Week Industrial Internship after 4th Semester <br>
                    3. 6-8 Week Industrial Internship after 6th Semester.<br />
                    In addition to this Institute may also permit B.Tech. students to undergo 6-month internship cum
                    placement (subject to grant of specific permission by the Institute) during 8th Semester of B. Tech.
                    for
                    which specific eligibility conditions are to be met by the students. The policy applicable to the
                    students
                    for placements will also be applicable for the students seeking 6-month internship.
                    <br>

                    <h2>Key Points</h2>
                    <h3>
                        1. The students who want to avail the 6-months internship during their 8th semester must not
                        have
                        more than 3 backlogs. Also, a limit of 50% of the total student strength per department is
                        proposed.<br>
                        2. Students opting 6-month internship will be allowed to appear in campus placements like all
                        other
                        students.<br>
                        3. Students can avail 6-months internships in either an industry or a research laboratory
                        strictly
                        through Institute Training and Placement cell. Only those students who are selected through
                        campus will be permitted to undergo six months’ internship.<br>
                        4. The internships have to be strictly completed at least one week before the deadline of
                        submitting
                        the grades as mentioned in the academic calendar.<br>
                        5. All such students who wish to undertake a 6-month internship or those who are selected for
                        such
                        an internship will have to give an undertaking that such internship will not affect their
                        academic
                        output.</h3>
                    <h2>Guidelines to the Departments</h2>
                    <h3>
                        1. Each department will form an “Internship advisory committee, IAC” to address all academic
                        activities related to the internship, allotment of course, and all activities ranging from
                        approving
                        an internship to grading.<br>
                        2. Department will ensure the implementation of all the provisions of this policy.
                        3. The role of the IAC is as follows:<br> a. Evaluate the Internship Notification Form (INF)
                        received from the company and make a
                        decision on approving the internship.<br>
                        b. The committee will form an evaluation criterion for the internship as per the following
                        guidelines:<br>

                        i. At the end of 6 months, each student is expected to submit a project report, and
                        make a presentation to a department-specific evaluation committee.<br>
                        ii. Grades will be given based on the quality of both, report and presentation, as well
                        as on the report submitted by the external supervisor.<br>
                        iii. Further details about the evaluation mechanism can be worked out by the
                        department.<br>
                        iv. For each student, the committee will appoint a faculty member as an internal
                        advisor.<br>
                        v. If a student finds an internship on his own, or a faculty member finds an internship
                        for students, the committee will inform the training and placement cell
                        immediately about such internships. The training and placement cell will allow
                        such internships only if the industry undergoes the campus selection process.<br>
                        vi. The committee will make decisions about policies of the respective departments
                        regarding the internships, whether to allow cross-disciplinary internships, or only
                        core-department related project or If a student is not given sufficient technical
                        work during the internship, initiate a mechanism to call the student back from the
                        company etc.<br>
                        4. The role of the internal advisor is as follows <br>
                        a. The advisor must conduct periodic evaluations (at least monthly) of the students’
                        progress, and stay in touch with the external supervisor appointed by the industry.<br>
                        b. At the end of every calendar month, the advisor will collect a progress-update from the
                        intern.<br>
                        c. In case a student has technical/non-technical issues during the internship, the internal
                        advisor will immediately talk to the student and the external supervisor to work out a
                        solution. If such a solution is not possible, the advisor will notify the internship advisory
                        committee of the same.<br>
                        d. The advisor will inform the IAC If a student is not given sufficient technical work during
                        the internship.
                    </h3>
                    <h2>Guidelines to the Companies</h2>
                    <h3>
                        1. An organization must share the all details pertaining to the internship and submit the duly
                        filled
                        INF to create an opening.<br>
                        2. It is expected that the organization should allot a well-defined project and a clearly stated
                        objectives for the student.<br>
                        3. Since internships involve academic credits, the company will have to allot a supervisor for
                        each
                        intern, called as external supervisor.<br>
                        4. The external supervisor is expected to share the progress of the intern on a regular basis
                        with the
                        internal advisor (a faculty from NIT Jalandhar). This will help the institute to monitor the
                        progress
                        of the project continuously. Moreover, at the end of each calendar month, the intern submits
                        monthly interim progress report to the internal advisor.<br>
                        5. The company is expected to release the list of selected candidates within two working days
                        after
